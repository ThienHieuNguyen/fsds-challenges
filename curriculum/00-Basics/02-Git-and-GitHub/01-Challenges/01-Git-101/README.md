3. Initiate a git repository in `git 101`. Add a `hello_world` file to your `git-101` directory. Write "Hello World! in it using command line only.

4. Push your repo to your GitHub account. Do not forget to create a remote, by using the following command : `git remote add origin git@github.com:<GITHUB-USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY-NAME>.git`.

5. Check manually on GitHub that the changes have been saved.

6. Delete your local folder `git-101` using command line only. Verify that it is still present on GitHub. Clone it again.
