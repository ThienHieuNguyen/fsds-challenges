## Context

Remember the game Minesweeper? I'm sure you also lost lot of hours playing on an old Windows machine.

If you are not familiar with the game, you can have a try now: http://minesweeperonline.com . Watch out it is super addictive.

To sum up the rules, imagine a grid of squares: some of these squares hide a **mine**.
- If you click on a mine, you lose instantly ‚ò†Ô∏è.
- If you click on a safe square, you can breath (and live another day) - and the square reveals a number telling you *how many mines are found in the squares that are immediately adjacent*. ‚úÖ

The aim of the game is to **uncover all squares in the grid that do not contain a mine**.

## Instructions

In this challenge, using Python and the power of Pandas library, we will code an algorithm that randomly creates a new grid game.
