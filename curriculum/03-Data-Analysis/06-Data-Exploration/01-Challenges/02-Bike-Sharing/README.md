## Instructions

Again, in this challenge you are on your own (with your paired student 👯‍) and you will run a deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an open source dataset, and present your results to the classroom.

The dataset to be analyzed is the following one: [Bike Sharing Demand](input/bike-sharing.csv). It contains data collected from a bike sharing system (either from a registered member or on an as-needed basis), and indicates the number rentals ("casual",  "registered" or the sum of both) depending on multiple features of the day.

We only provide information about the dataset, then it's your turn! 

Good luck 🤗


## Guidelines

The dataset contains the following columns. Use them wisely in order to provide an impactful data analysis:

```
datetime - hourly date + timestamp  
season -  1 = spring, 2 = summer, 3 = fall, 4 = winter 
holiday - whether the day is considered a holiday
workingday - whether the day is neither a weekend nor holiday
weather - 1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy 
2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist 
3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds 
4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog 
temp - temperature in Celsius
atemp - "feels like" temperature in Celsius
humidity - relative humidity
windspeed - wind speed
casual - number of non-registered user rentals initiated
registered - number of registered user rentals initiated
count - number of total rentals
```
