## Instructions

Let's go deeper in our understanding of data visualizations and in our skills at manipulating real life data.

In this challenge, we will explore **Airbnb data from Paris listings**. The objective is to answer the following question:

> **How does location impact listing price?** 

The data, that you will collect from [InsideAirbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) is a very complete dataset of Airbnb listings.

Feel free to play around, and to draw visualizations in order to better understand the data.

To get started, open the associated notebook and follow the instructions.

Good luck! 😉
