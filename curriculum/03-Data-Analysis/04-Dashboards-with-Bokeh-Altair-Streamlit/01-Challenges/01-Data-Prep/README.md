In this challenge, you will be asked to work on a COVID-19 database collected in Senegal. When fighting against pandemics, access to information is essential. However, as in many places in the world, Senegal does not offer a common COVID database and the government simply posts pictures of reports on Twitter.

Information from those tweets have been extracted, and you will build a dashboard to monitor the progress of COVID-19 in Senegal. In this first challenge, you will explore the dataset, create charts in Matplotlib and Altair and gather insights from your exploration.
