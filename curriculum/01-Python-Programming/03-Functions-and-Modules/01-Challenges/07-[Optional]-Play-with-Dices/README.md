## Objectives
Train yourself with dices games

## Guidelines
- Prompt the user for a number between 2 and 12, and return the number of possibilities to achieve this score while simultaneously throwing 2 dices.

- Same question with a number n between 3 and 18 and 3 dices.

- Generalize the question : ask the user for a number of dices `nbd` (between 1 and 10) and the score `s` he wants to achive (`s` is between `nbd` and `6 * nbd`), and return the number of possibilities to achieve the score `s` with `nbd` dices.

- Try to solve the same question recursively.
