## Objectives
Count the number of uppercase and lowercase characters in a given text

## Guidelines
Open `src/basic_text_analysis.py` with your text editor and write a function that returns the number of uppercase and lower case characters in a given `text`.

Your program should then (see example below) :
- ask the user to input some text
- return a short message displaying the results.
```
What is the text to analyse ?
> To paraphrase Oedipus, Hamlet, Lear, and all those guys, I wish I had known this some time ago.
The text contains 95 characters with 6 upper letters and 67 lower ones.
```
