## Objectives
Implement Pascal's triangle

## Guidelines
[Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle) is a triangle in which each entry is the sum of the two immediately above. It is a well-known representation of the binomial coefficients.

You have to implement Pascal's triangle both iteratively and recursively, for any given number of rows.

Your program must be written in `src/pascal_triangle.py`.
