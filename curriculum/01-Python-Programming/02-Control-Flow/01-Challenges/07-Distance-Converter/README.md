## Objectives
Convert distances between miles and km

## Guidelines
Create a simple distance converter :
- asking for a distance to convert (figure and unit)
- returning the distance measured in the other convention system
- the converter should work in both ways

Your program must be written in `src/distance_converter.py`.
