## Guidelines

Given a list of integers, return the **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You can assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you cannot use the same element twice.

Your program must be written in `src/Target-Number.py`.

#### Example

Given the list `[2, 7, 1, 4, 3]` and the target `10`, your function would return `[1, 4]`, because 7 (at index 1) and 3 (at index 4) sum up to 10 (the target).
