## Objectives
Model a circle to improve your OOP skills.

## Guidelines
Write a class `Circle` :
- a circle is defined by the coordinates of its center `x0` and `y0` and also by its radius `R`. By default, the center is located at the origin (0,0) and the radius is 1.
- write instance methods to compute the `position()`, the `area()` and the `circumference()` of a circle.
- write a method `is_in_circle()` that returns whether a point of coordinates `x` and `y` is located in a given circle.

Your program must be written in `src/circle.py`. You should be able to instanciate circles and play with them directly from your iPython console.
