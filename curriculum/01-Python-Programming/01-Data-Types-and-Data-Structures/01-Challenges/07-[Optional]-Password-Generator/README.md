## Objectives
Write a password generator in Python.

## Guidelines
Be creative with how you generate passwords : strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, number and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password.

Your program must be written in `src/password_genertor.py`. You may need to use the `random` and `string` modules : check the documentation.

### Bonus
Ask the user how strong they want their password to be.
