## Objectives
Determine if a given word is a palindrome.

## Guidelines
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, like “madam” for example.

Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not.

Your program must be written in `src/palindrome.py`. You may need to use an `if / else` statement : check the documentation.

### Bonus (more difficult)
For a given input string S, return the longest palindrome found within. If multiple substrings qualify, print them all in the same order as they appear in S.
