## Objectives
Find smallest window that contains all characters of a given string.

## Guidelines
In a given text, extract the smallest sequence of characters containing all the characters present in the text.

Open `src/string_brain_teaser.py` with your text editor and implement the `smallest_sub_string` function.

I/O : prompt the user to ask for a text to analyse and a sequence of letters.

#### Example

Given the string `"abracadabra"`, all the unique characters in that string are "a", "b", "c", "d", "r". The smallest substring from `"abracadabra"` that contains all those characters would be `"bracad"`.
