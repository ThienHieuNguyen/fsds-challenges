The more data we have, the better performance we can achieve! It's easy with numerical data (see the lessons on Customer Churn and Anomaly Detection), but with texts it's a bit more complicated. We will see how to use word embeddings to do that.

First of all, let's go back to the spam classifier challenge of the 01-Processing-Text course. The aim is to improve your results of this exercice with text augmentation.

Remember, a spam classifier is a Machine Learning model that classifies texts (email or SMS) into two categories: spam (1) or ham (0).

## Guidelines
Open the `src/01-Text-Augmentation.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions.
