In this last exercise, we will focus on generating speech samples from a pre-trained model. The idea is that you just type in the text to generate, and just like in Google services, it generates the speech with a natural voice.

In this exercise, we will use the TransformerTTS from Axel Springer (https://github.com/as-ideas/TransformerTTS) available on Github.

To do it simply and avoiding having to make all the installs on your own machine, follow the [Colab notebook prepared by Axel Springer](https://colab.research.google.com/github/as-ideas/TransformerTTS/blob/master/notebooks/synthesize_autoregressive_wavernn.ipynb). Try to generate some speech samples.
