## Guidelines

In this exercise, you will work with a pre-extracted CSV dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/primaryobjects/voicegender). Use this CSV as a simple introduction to see what kind of model works on top of these features. Do not spend too much time here, since you will build one from scratch at the next step.
