## Guidelines

In this exercise, you will make a classifier to predict whether a tweet from Trump is actually from himself or his campaign team.

To do so, you will use the data into the file `src/trump_tweet_2016.csv`, and try to predict whether a tweet comes from Android or from iPhone: tweets from android were from Donald Trump, while tweets from iPhone were from his campaign team.
