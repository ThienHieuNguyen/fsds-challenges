## Guidelines

In the `src` folder, you will find source texts (Asource.txt, Bsource.txt, Csource.txt and Dsource.txt) from which some texts were inspired (A1.txt was inspired from Asource.txt and so on). 

Your job is to use text similarity to define a plagiarism detection algorithm based on those short examples.

In the examples, there are sources, direct plagiarism (A1, B1, C1, D1) and sometimes examples of so called mosaic plagiarism (D2). Can you make an algorithm that detects all kind of plagiarism without false positive?
