## Instructions

You are given a table `roads` with the following structure:

  ``` sql
  CREATE TABLE roads (
      km_start INTEGER NOT NULL,
      km_end INTEGER NOT NULL,
      CHECK(start <= end),
      UNIQUE(start, end)
  );
  ```

Each record in this table represents a contiguous road, that goes from kilometer `km_start` to kilometer `km_end` inclusive (with `km_start` <= `km_end` and length equal to `km_end` âˆ’ `km_start`).

Consider the different parts covered by the roads.

Write an SQL query that returns the total length (in kilometers) of all the parts covered by roads specified in the table `roads`. Note that any parts of `roads` that are covered by several overlapping roads should be counted only once.

For example, given:
```
km_start | km_end
---------+--------
       1 | 6
       3 | 4
       5 | 8
      10 | 12
```

your query should return: **7** kilometers

Indeed, the roads cover kilometers 1 to 8 (and kilometers 8 to 10 were not covered)
