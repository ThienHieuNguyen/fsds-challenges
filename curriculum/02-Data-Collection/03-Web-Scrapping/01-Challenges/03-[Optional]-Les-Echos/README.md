## Objectives

- Write a scrapper and a crawler

## Guidelines

### Scrapping

Write a python script to explore the website of newspaper [Les Echos](https://www.lesechos.fr).

Your script should allow you to :
- Find all articles relating to artificial intelligence dating back to January 1st 2019
- Get the text content of each of those articles, including titles and subtitles
- You might need to look up the library `selenium` and its [documentation](https://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/) to complete your objective.

Your code must be written in `src/echos.py`.

**Bonus :** You can improve your scrapper by passing parameters that allow you to select a subject and a time range and get all articles from that time range relating to that chosen subject.
