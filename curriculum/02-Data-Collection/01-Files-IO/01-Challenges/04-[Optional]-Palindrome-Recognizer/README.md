# Objectives

Text files manipulation.

# Guidelines

Write a version of a palindrome recogniser that accepts a file name from the user, reads each line, and prints the line to the screen if it is a palindrome.
Your palindrome recognizer should ignore capitalization, punctuation and spaces.
Use the file located in the `input` folder to test your code, then try it with your own files !
