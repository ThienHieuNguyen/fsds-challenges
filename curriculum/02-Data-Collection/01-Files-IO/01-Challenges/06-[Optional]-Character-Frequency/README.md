# Objectives

Text files manipulation.

# Guidelines

Write a function char_freq_table() that, when run in a terminal, accepts a file name from the user, builds a frequency listing of the characters contained in the file, and outputs a sorted and nicely formatted character frequency table to the `frequency_table.csv` located in the `output` folder.
