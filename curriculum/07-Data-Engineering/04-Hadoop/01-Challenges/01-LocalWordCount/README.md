# Python Scripts in MapReduce

Big Data tools are great, but if you have to learn a new language every time you use a new tool, this slows down the development of such tools. For this reason, it is possible to submit Python scripts to Hadoop using a Map-Reduce framework. Let's consider the WordCount example.

Any job in Hadoop must have two phases: 
- Mapper 
- and Reducer. 

In this exercise, we will have to create a WordCount in MapReduce locally.
