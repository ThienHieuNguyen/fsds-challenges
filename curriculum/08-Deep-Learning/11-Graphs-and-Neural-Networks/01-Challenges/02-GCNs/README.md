In this exercise, you will be asked to play around with the official implementation of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). The code has been adapted so that you are able to run it in the Juypter notebook directly, and not through command lines. 

In this example, you will:
- load a graph
- try to make predictions through classical MLP
- try to make predictions through GCNs 
- observe the results
- read the code of the implementation
- fine-tune the parameters
- repeat it for other networks
