## Guidelines

In this exercise, you will be asked to :
- complete the code to create your first GAN
- train a GAN to generate digits based on the MNIST dataset

You should be able to generate new digits by the end of the exercise. This exercise can be ran locally using `src/01-DigitGeneration.ipynb`, but you can also go for a notebook in Google Colab for example.

Good luck !
