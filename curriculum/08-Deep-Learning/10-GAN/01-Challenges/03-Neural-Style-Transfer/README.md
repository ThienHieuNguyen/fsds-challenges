## Guidelines

Neural Style Transfer is a specialized variation of GANs that allows you to transfer the style of an image to another. In this exercise, we'll use Google Colab to transfer the stlye of Mona Lisa's painting to the official portrait of Trump.

In the second part, you'll be totally free to choose whatever content image and style image, and make your own style transfer !

Have fun :)
