    "# Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The original MNIST image dataset of handwritten digits is a popular benchmark for image-based machine learning methods but researchers have renewed efforts to update it and develop drop-in replacements that are more challenging for computer vision and original for real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "To stimulate the community to develop more drop-in replacements, **the Sign Language MNIST** presented here follows the same CSV format with labels and pixel values in single rows. The American Sign Language letter database of hand gestures represent **a multi-class problem with 24 classes of letters (excluding J and Z which require motion).**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset format is patterned to match closely with the classic MNIST. Each training and test case represents a label (0-25) as a one-to-one map for each alphabetic letter A-Z (and no cases for 9=J or 25=Z because of gesture motions). The training data (27,455 cases) and test data (7172 cases) are approximately half the size of the standard MNIST but otherwise similar with a header row of label, pixel1,pixel2….pixel784 which represent a single 28x28 pixel image with grayscale values between 0-255.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to train a classifier to recognize the hand sign on each image.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Use Google colab for this project.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are largely free to follow your own heart in conducting this project. Nevertheless, here are some indications that can help you :\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Don't forget to explore the data** : display some images and their labels, explore the distribution of classes in the train set, etc.\n",
    "- **Use the [ImageDataGenerator](https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html) from Keras to practice some data augmentation** : it can help you avoid overfitting and lets you generate more data to train your model.\n",
    "- You can start by trying the **classic Net5 architecture** on this dataset, and tweaking it depending on your results.\n",
    "- Whatever the performance of your model (even if it is excellent !), **explore the predictions** : display some test images with the true label and the predicted label, and display the confusion matrix of your model."
