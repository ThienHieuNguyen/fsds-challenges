## Guidelines

In this mini project, you will predict amazon reviews. The dataset `amazon_reviews.txt` contains 10000 unprocessed reviews.

To help you, here are the steps to follow:
* Data loading and preprocessing: create your X (e.g. BOW output) and y (labels)
* Model building: design your RNN model
* Training and performance estimation
* Iterations: try to improve your performances

If you have time, compare results with traditional NLP!
