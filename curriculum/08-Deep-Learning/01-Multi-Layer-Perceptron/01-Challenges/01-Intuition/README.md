## Guidelines

To begin easily with neural networks and develop your intuitions, you will play with the tensorflow playground [here](playground.tensorflow.org).

Play with all the availables possibilities:
- play with the input features
- play with the number of layers and units
- play with the activation function
- do so with all the datasets: especially the spiral is quite challenging
