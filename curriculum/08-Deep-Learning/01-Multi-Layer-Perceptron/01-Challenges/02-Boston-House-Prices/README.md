## Guidelines

We will apply our new knowledge on MLP to a classical regression use case : house price prediction on `scikit-learn` boston dataset.

1. Load the dataset and prepare it.
2. Model a five layers neural network with 100 neurons each and train it.
3. Compare your results with a classical linear regression.
