## Guidelines

In this challenge, you will implement your very own K-means algorithm.

As a reminder, there is 3 steps in a K-means algorithm:

1. Initialization: choose random cluster centers

2. Assignment: assign each point to a cluster

3. Update: update the clusters' centers


In order to do so, we will need some helper functions, in addition to functions to perform those 3 steps.

We need a function to compute the distance of a point to another, a function to compute a cluster's center and a function to find the closest cluster.

Now, open the `src/04-Implementation.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions.
