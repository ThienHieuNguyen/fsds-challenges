In this exercise, you will be asked to explore time series data.

⚠️Don't use Prophet in this exercise, use models seen in class :)

You will be working with time series of Open Power System Data ([OPSD](https://open-power-system-data.org/)) for Germany. 

The data set includes daily electricity consumption, wind power production, and solar power production between 2006 and 2017. 
```
- Date — The date (yyyy-mm-dd format)
- Consumption — Electricity consumption in GWh
- Wind — Wind power production in GWh
- Solar — Solar power production in GWh
- Wind+Solar — Sum of wind and solar power production in GWh
```
