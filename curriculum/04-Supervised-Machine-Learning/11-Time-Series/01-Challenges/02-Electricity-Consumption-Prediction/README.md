In this exercise, you will be asked to use insights from the previous exploration, and build forecasts for the electricity consumption.

You will be working with time series of Open Power System Data (OPSD) for Germany.

The data set includes daily electricity consumption, wind power production, and solar power production between 2006 and 2017.

- Date — The date (yyyy-mm-dd format)
- Consumption — Electricity consumption in GWh
- Wind — Wind power production in GWh
- Solar — Solar power production in GWh
- Wind+Solar — Sum of wind and solar power production in GWh
