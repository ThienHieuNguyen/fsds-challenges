## Instructions

In this challenge, you will apply some of what you've learned about the SHAP method for model explainability on a dataset. Let's work again on the cover types dataset, located in the `input` folder.

For information, the classes names are the following :

```python
y_names = {
    1: "Spruce/Fir",
    2: "Lodgepole Pine",
    3: "Ponderosa Pine",
    4: "Cottonwood/Willow",
    5: "Aspen",
    6: "Douglas-fir",
    7: "Krummholz"
}
```
