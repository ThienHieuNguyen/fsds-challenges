## Instructions

So far, we have used packages to implement the classifiers. The packages are great, and usually well optimized. XGBoost or Catboost would take weeks to re-implement. However, Adaboost is surprisingly simple to implement. In this notebook, you will be asked to implement it from scratch.

We will break down the problem into several steps. Our aim is to create a class that contains 2 functions (+ the init function) : 
- a fit function
- and a predict function

We will also try to create our own class!

To help you out, follow the instructions in the notebook `src/03-AdaBoost.ipynb`.
