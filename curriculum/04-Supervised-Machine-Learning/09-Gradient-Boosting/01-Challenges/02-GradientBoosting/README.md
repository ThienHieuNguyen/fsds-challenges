## Instructions

In this notebook, we'll build our own high level implementation of the gradient boosting regressor. We will start this notebook with a quick recap of the pseudo-code of the gradient boosting. Don't worry if you don't understand everything, the aim of this notebook is that you understand the high level idea.

You will be asked to use Sklearn Decision Tree Regressor (`DecisionTreeRegressor`) with a max-depth of 1, called a stump. You won't have to code this by yourself.

The data will be simulated in the first part of the notebook in `src/02-GradientBoosting.ipynb`. Good luck!
