## Instructions

The Titanic dataset you saw this morning during the course is a classical exercise. So if you feel like you're still having time after the airbnb dataset preparation, you can try to redo the Titanic on your own. There are plenty of things to do to improve the accuracy.

## Guidelines

Here are things you can do to improve your model accuracy:
- Use different methods for scaling continuous data or encoding categorical data
- Use features we did not in the lecture
- Handle missing values in a more smart way
- Going further with feature engineering: you can create new features that will help your model
