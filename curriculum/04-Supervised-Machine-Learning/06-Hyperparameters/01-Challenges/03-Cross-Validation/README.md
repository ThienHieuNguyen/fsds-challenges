## Instructions

This exercise will be about cross-validation. Cross-validation is widely used in hyperparameter search (both grid search and random search). Since this is always good to understand what we are doing, in this exercise you will implement your own cross validation function.

Open the notebook in `src/01-Cross-Validation.ipynb` and follow the instructions.
