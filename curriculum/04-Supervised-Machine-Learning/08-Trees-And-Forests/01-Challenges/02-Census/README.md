In this project, we will be working on this open sourced [Census dataset containing income information](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income).

Leveraging this census data and based on everything you have learnt so far, the goal is to predict **whether or not a person makes more than $50,000** from the information contained in the other columns.

You can download the data here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income

### 1. Exploratory Analysis

As usual, you will start by exploring the data. In particular, make a quick statistic based and univariate audit of the main columns‚Äô content and produce the results in visual format.

This audit should describe the variable distribution, the % of missing values, the extreme values, and so on.

### 2. Prediction üîÆ

Now that you understand better the data, and that the dataset is clean, it is time to train predictive models and climb your way up to the highest accuracy score üèÜ

Choose carefully your features, you can even create new ones, and focus on training **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests**.

Improve your models by finding the optimal hyperparameters that minimize your models' error.

### 3. Profiling

Find clear insights on the profiles of the people that make more than $50,000 / year. For example, which variables seem to be the most correlated with this phenomenon?

#### Notes

This challenge was proposed by *[Dataiku](dataiku.com)* as an interview homework for Data Scientist position.
