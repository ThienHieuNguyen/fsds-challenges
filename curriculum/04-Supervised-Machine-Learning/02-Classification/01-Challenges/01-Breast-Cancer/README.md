## Instructions

Previously, we built k-NN model from scratch. Hopefully, there exists libraries and functions in Python so that we don't always have to rebuild the wheel - and we can directly call those functions.

Today we will play with medical data and build model in order to predict if the data collected from patient nuclei is **malignant** or **benign**.

You can get more information about this dataset here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)

Open the associated notebook and follow instructions.
