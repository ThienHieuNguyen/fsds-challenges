## Instructions

**MNIST** is a dataset published in 1998 by *Yann LeCun* (current Head of AI at Facebook), *Corinna Cortes and Chris Burges* when working on handwritten digit recognition.

It is **THE ultimate challenge** for computer vision data scientists. See how people [compete and try to build the best model that will reach the highest score](http://rodrigob.github.io/are_we_there_yet/build/classification_datasets_results.html)
