## Instructions

### Choose your own algorithm and implement it

In this challenge, you will ride all by yourself 💪 And implement an algorithm of your choice end-to-end.

A few tips in order to be successful (in this challenge - and more generally in  your data scientist job):

- **ALL** information is online! An important part of your job is to search for answers efficiently and to find quickly what you are looking for. It can be in the scikit-learn documentation, on StackOverflow, in GitHub Issues, in forums, etc.
- Don't hesitate to ask for help - to your paired student, your teacher, your coworker, etc.
- Test, Fail, Explore! 👨‍🔬

Open the notebook and follow the instructions.
