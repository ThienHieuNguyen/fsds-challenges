Let's apply all that you have learned today on a real usecase : the [NYC Taxi Trip Duration](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/overview) challenge from Kaggle.

Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data).

The objective of this challenge is to predict the duration of a taxi trip in NYC, using data about 1.5 million trips that were taken in New-York in the first half of 2016.

## 1st step : load and clean the data
You might need quite a lot of preprocessing on this dataset to clean it up.

## 2nd step : explore the data
There are a lot of interesting insights that can be gained from exploring this dataset. Do not skip over this part !

## 3rd step : choose a ML model and make your predictions

## 4th step : evaluate your model
Some questions to ask yourself regarding the metric :
- What kind of ML problem is this challenge (classification/regression) ?
- Which metric would be the most optimized to evaluate the model's performance ?
- The challenge on Kaggle was actually evaluated using a less conventional metric. Explore the available informations about this metric and make your own conclusion as to why it was chosen as the most appropriate for this challenge.
