## Instructions

In this challenge, we will go further in our understanding of Machine Learning logic and of regression problems.

The problem stated is very similar to the previous one (and the goal is the same: predict a real estate price). But this time the dataset contains more information or **features** (explanatory variables). We will explore new Machine Learning models and discuss how to improve our model performances.

As always, you will bring extra care at properly visualizing, cleaning, transforming your data - core job of a Data Scientist.

Open the associated notebook and follow the instructions.
