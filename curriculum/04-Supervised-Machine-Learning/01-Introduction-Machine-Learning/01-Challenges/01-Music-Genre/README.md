## Objective

Build a predictor for music genre

## Instructions


### 1. Load the data

The first step is to load the data into a `pandas` dataframe so we can start studying it. You can find the data [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1K72z20VX0JA6q7iXMKFxqiehZVgNAA45)

### 2. Visualise the data

Do a quick general overview of the data : print out a few lines, print out the column names

### 3. Explore the data

Explore all the columns to check if the data may be used or not.
Clean out the dataset.
Check the distribution of the data.

Determine which column will be the feature you are trying to predict

### 4. Train your model

Use the model you have written in the previous exercise and train it to fit the data.
Check your accuracy

### 5. Predict the Music Genre

Congratulations, now you should be able to tell with certainty the type of music you are listening to!
